= Contributing code to the jspwiki2pdf project =

The easiest way to contribute to this project is to mimic the way I do development on the project.

I use [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ Eclipse 3.3+] and import the project into my workspace. I use [http://maven.apache.org/download.html Maven 2.0.4+] for building and maintaining the dependancies.

In order to get dependant JARs you must run the {{{mvn}}} command at least once for Maven to be able to download all dependancies.

Since the JSPWiki source wasn't available in the [http://www.mvnrepository.com/search.html?query=jspwiki Maven repository] last I checked, you need to add [http://jspwiki.org/wiki/AnonymousCVSAccess import JSPWiki as a project into Eclipse] as well.

All set! Just do your work and run {{{mvn package}}} to create a new JAR-file for testing your modifications.

If you need commit acces, [mailto:brattberg@gmail.com send me an email].
